omniauth-uber-drivers
=====================

This is the omniauth strategy for the Uber Drivers API.

You may view the [Uber Drivers API documentation](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/introduction).

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-uber-drivers'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :uber_drivers, ENV['UBER_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['UBER_CLIENT_SECRET']
end
```

Do not forget setting the scope. By default it is settup to `partner.accounts`.

From the docs:

> Scopes control the various API endpoints your application can access. When requesting an access token to use on behalf of a driver your application will specify which scopes it needs and these will be shown to the user during the OAuth flow. Itâ€™s best to limit the scopes you need to the bare minimum so that drivers can feel confident with your app and the amount of data it can access.

Available scopes: `partner.accounts`, `partner.payments`, `partner.trips`.  Default: `partner.accounts`

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :uber_drivers, ENV['UBER_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['UBER_CLIENT_SECRET'], :scope => 'partner.accounts,partner.payments'
end

```
